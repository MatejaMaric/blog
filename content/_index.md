My name is Mateja Marić. I'm a 23 years old software engineer from Belgrade, Serbia.

I learned my first programming language when I was a kid and have been working professionally for about 3 years now.
In those 3 years I've been lucky to try out basically every aspect of programming and maintaining web applications (Frontend, Backend, DevOps).
And with that I realised, what I kind of knew from the start, that I'm most interested in backend development.
Naturally, I'm very glad and it helped me a lot to experience every part of the process.
Interestingly enough, I would say my biggest lessons from working in the industry so far were not technical, but interpersonal.

Through the years I realised what I valued the most about software engineering is the ability to express ideas.
It's my belief that programming truly is a form of art.
With that, programming language design is one field of computer science that never ceased to interest me.
Right now, I'm most interested in purely functional programming languages.

I also value a lot, open source and
<a target="_blank" rel="external follow" href="https://www.fsf.org/about/what-is-free-software">free (as in freedom)</a>
software.
At some point, I used only free and open source software, but since I got employed that's sadly no longer the case...

Besides my interest in computers, I would say I'm a very curious person in general and have other interest in both natural and social sciences.
