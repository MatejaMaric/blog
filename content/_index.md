I am Mateja Maric, a 19 years old student from Belgrade, Serbia.

I was interested in computers ever since I laid my hands on one and I taught myself to program in C++ when I was 12 years old.
Throughout the years I learned bunch of other programming languages and technologies.
I also know the basics of electrical engineering, digital electronics and how computers work on transistor level.

I used to be very interested in game development and I played a lot with Unity and Unreal Engine.
However, in summer of 2018 my interests shifted quite a bit.
I started using GNU/Linux exclusively and became primarily interested in <a target="_blank" rel="external follow" href="https://www.fsf.org/about/what-is-free-software">free(as in freedom)</a> software Unix-like operating systems and web technologies.
