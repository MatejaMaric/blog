I am Mateja Marić, a 21 years old software engineer from Belgrade, Serbia.

I was interested in computers ever since I laid my hands on one and I taught myself to program in C++ when I was a kid.
Throughout the years I learned bunch of other programming languages and technologies.
I also know the basics of electrical engineering, digital electronics and how computers work on transistor level.

I used to be very interested in game development and computer graphics.
I played a lot with different game engines and I made my own 3D render from scratch.
However, in summer of 2018 my interests shifted quite a bit.
I started using GNU/Linux exclusively and became primarily interested in

software, Unix-like operating systems and web technologies.
