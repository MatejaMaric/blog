I am Mateja Marić, a 22 years old software engineer from Belgrade, Serbia.

I was interested in computers ever since I laid my hands on one and I taught myself to program in C++ when I was a kid.
Throughout the years I learned bunch of other programming languages and technologies.
I also know the basics of electrical engineering, digital electronics and how computers work on transistor level.

Like every kid, I was very interested in game development and computer graphics.
I played a lot with different game engines and I made my own 3D render from scratch.
However, in summer of 2018, I started using GNU/Linux exclusively and stopped playing games completely.
I became primarily interested in <a target="_blank" rel="external follow" href="https://www.fsf.org/about/what-is-free-software">free(as in freedom)</a>
software, Unix-like operating systems and web technologies.
Right now, I'm most interested in purely functional programming and programming language design.
