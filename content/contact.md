You can send me an e-mail at: mail@matejamaric.com

<b>Please, check your spam folder!</b> 
<br>Sometimes big e-mail providers put e-mail from smaller domains in spam folder, Microsoft is especially notorious for this practice.
<br>Of course, you can always whitelist my domain to be sure that my e-mails won't end up in your spam folder.

I also have a <a href="/mateja-key.asc" download>public PGP key</a> if you wish to use it for asymmetric encryption.
